# About
This is the repository for my portfolio, which can be found at [russellhoy.com](russellhoy.com). It is built in jekyll and hosted on github pages.



In the interest of building this project quickly I used the following technologies:

- Yeoman, to quickly set up the HTML5 Boilerplate, Jekyll structure, and Grunt tasks for Jekyll.
- Grunt to manage my development work flow and quick deployment and optimization.
- Bootstrap and Font Icon for quick styling to make it look presentable on different screens.
- [Squaresend](https://squaresend.com) for the beautifulÂ and simple messaging interface.
- JQuery (+ ScrollTo plugin) for the subtle interactive effects.


All things considered, I think it was a great approach to building an easily maintainable, solid looking portfolio very quickly. If I had more time, I would love to build it with trendier technology from scratch and get rid of the dependencies ... but that's for another day.

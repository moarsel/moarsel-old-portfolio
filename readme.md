# About
This is the repository for my portfolio, which can be found at [russellhoy.com](russellhoy.com). It is built in jekyll and hosted on github pages. The entire project isn't visible here, because github pages requires a certain file structure in order for the hosting to work properly.


In the interest of building this project quickly (2 days) I used the following technologies:

- Yeoman, to quickly set up the HTML5 Boilerplate, Jekyll structure, and Grunt tasks for Jekyll.
- Grunt to manage my development work flow and quick deployment and optimization.
- Bootstrap and Font Icon for quick styling to make it look presentable on different screens.
- [Squaresend](https://squaresend.com) for the beautifulÂ and simple messaging interface.
- JQuery, to work quickly on the interactive elements.


All things considered, I think it was a great approach to building an easily maintainable, solid looking portfolio very quickly. Now that I've had more than a few days to build a portfolio, I've used some more sexy technology to get a better result (Sass, Bourbon + Neat, Grunt, and Jekyll).

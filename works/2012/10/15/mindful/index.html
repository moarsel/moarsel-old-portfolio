After finishing the 2013 edition, we realized at the last moment we would need a cover. Although I intended to make something really simple, I ended up rendering a scene in 3d and finishing it up in photoshop. For the featured image I wanted something that represented our college (Trinity college) but also the content of the journal. The reflective spheres represent the different perspectives in the journal and they reflect the <em>Quad</em>, the heart of Trinity College.</p><p>The spheres were made in 3d, then I set up environment mapping, and rendered them together with a path tracer (in Blender). Next, I took the spheres and placed them on a simple background texture, along with the text on the cover. The cover page had to follow with the visual identity of previous covers, the font family and basic layout had to remain the same (with minor stylistic changes).</p><p>The project had to be finished within a very short time period, but I was pretty happy with the result.</p></div></div></article><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,400|Arvo" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><script src=/js/script.2592.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=

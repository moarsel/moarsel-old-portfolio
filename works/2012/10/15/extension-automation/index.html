As users browsed around, was no limit to the number of extensions running scripts and slowing down the loading and rendering of pages. Most of these extensions were only meant to be used on certain sites or certain types of sites!</p><h1 id=the-solution>The Solution</h1><p>By having a single extension dictate which extension should be active for a given web page, I was able to speed up browsing for power users, while also getting rid of extension buttons that took up unnecessary space on the tool bar (and taking up unnecessary memory in the background).</p><p>After installing <em>Extension Automation</em>, users simply type in which sites they want a certain extension to load for (or not load for), then the extension handles the rest automatically.</p><h1 id=the-reception>The Reception</h1><p><em>Extension Automation</em> was very well received. At its peak it had several thousand active users and got featured on sites like <a href=http://lifehacker.com/5890518/extension-automation-enables-extensions-based-on-specific-websites>lifehacker</a>, <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/extension-automation-enable-disable-extensions/">makeuseof</a> and <a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/enable-chrome-extensions-automatically-for-preset-sites/">CNET</a>.</p><p>In the past 1.5 years, chrome has gotten better APIs for extensions that only activate for single websites. They’ve also changed the APIs and package requirements so often that I haven’t had time to keep the extension up to date on the chrome webstore.</p><p>As of October 2014, there were still 4,300 weekly active users. Even though I built the extension to “scratch my own itch”, it was evidently useful to other users as well.</p></div></div></article><footer class=alternate><h2>I would love to work with you!

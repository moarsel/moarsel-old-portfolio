Although the idea came up about a year ago, over past 6 months I built out most of the functionality as an experiment in building a business and improving my coding abilities.</p><h2 id=a-tour-of-mystorybookcom>A Tour of MyStorybook.com</h2><p>When you go to <a href="https://www.mystorybook.com/books/new/"><em>My Storybook</em></a>, you can start a new book right away without signing up. To start with, visitors are brought through a little tutorial which shows them how to:</p><ul><li>edit the book title</li><li>add customizable characters</li><li>add images (or upload your own)</li><li>add the background image for the scene</li><li>write the story’s text</li><li>navigate through the story’s pages and add new pages</li><li>doodle on the page</li></ul><p>All of this functionality is built with jQuery and HTML5 Canvas as well as SVG images so that we can make high resolution prints of the stories. After first starting my own Canvas manipulation library we migrated to <a href="https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/">FabricJS</a> for its huge wealth of features. The entire back end was done with Ruby on Rails and hosted on Heroku.</p><p>When users have gone through the tutorial, they can choose to quickly sign up without leaving the page. Stories are saved automatically via AJAX as changes are made. After your story is done, you can choose to make it public, share it, and/or buy a copy of it. If you want to keep your story, you can get the PDF ebook version or a printed book shipped to you.</p><h2 id=building-books-in-the-back-end>Building Books in the Back End</h2><p>I experimented with making the PDFs with several different technologies. First I tried (<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomJS</a>, but the rendering of SVG and HTML5 Canvas wasn’t always perfect. <a href=https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF>jsPDF</a> is a very cool client side PDF renderer, but with high resolution images it was just too memory intensive. I also tried several Ruby on Rails specific solutions such as <a href="http://prawnpdf.org/">Prawn</a>, <a href=https://github.com/adjust/shrimp>Shrimp</a>, <a href=https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit>PDFKit</a>, and <a href="https://docraptor.com/">Docraptor</a>. Docraptor was the only solution of these that was fast enough, and completely accurate in its rendering, but since it is a paid solution the pricing didn’t make sense for this project.</p><p>Finally, after spending way too long testing different methods, I set up <a href=https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf>WickedPDF</a> as a background job, and with some sneaky workarounds, got it to accurately reproduce the pages in high resolution.</p><p>Next, I implemented payment using Stripe. Luckily, it’s so easy to get started with Stripe that the bulk of this was finished within a week. Of course, you always have to be extra careful when dealing with credit cards and payment so testing this took a little longer.</p><p>Published stories show up in our library, where we display the cover page as well as the description and title given in each story. Along with a few other administration tools, we can tag books and display them in different categories (“halloween stories”, “featured stories”, etc.)</p><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>The design for myStorybook.com was meant to be very bright yet as simple as possible. Our competitors tended to have complicated flash based pages, and we wanted to stand out by being simple and colourful. The logo design and graphics were mostly done in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>. All the CSS was based around Twitter’s Bootstrap so that the site could easily be made responsive and mobile friendly (Something our competitors using flash could not easily do). Since the site was already using HTML5 features like Canvas, I liberally applied some fun CSS3 such as 3d transforms on the storybook thumbnail previews.</p><p>I also spent a fair bit of time thinking about the UX and information architechture. Most importantly, everything has to be simple and fun enough for a young student to be able to navigate and it had to be delightful to use. While there are some tweaks needed to make the UX better, our user stats and feedback suggest that we are on the right track.</p><h2 id=reception>Reception</h2><p>MyStorybook.com is still kind of a work in progress (we need more art, and a few interface improvements, mobile optimization, etc), but it has been very well received. The education technology community has been very positive, and many schools are already using the site. Industry leaders such as <a href=https://twitter.com/Larryferlazzo>Larry Ferlazzo</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/rmbyrne>Richard Byrne</a> reviewed the app <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2014/09/09/my-storybook-is-a-new-free-good-site-for-students-to-write-online/">here</a> and <a href=http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2014/09/mystorybook-good-platform-for-creating.html>here</a></p><p>We even got a permanent feature on the worlds most popular free kids stories website: <a href="http://www.magickeys.com/books/">magickeys.com</a> (just google “children’s stories”). I haven’t been able to spend as much time on marketing and SEO for this project yet but organic ranking and traffic has been decent. As of October 2014, we’ve had 22000 sessions; 20% is from search engines, and people spend an average of almost 8 minutes per visit. There’s always more to do, but it feels great to launch such a complex site!</p></div></div></article><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script><script>document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.2592.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
